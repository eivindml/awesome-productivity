# Reddit Research

Thought it would be interesting to see what type of productivity systems/techniques/frameworks/rituals you all use on a regularly basis. It's loosely defined, by basically productivity concepts that has a name that can be googled to find more information about it!

It's fun to see how others put together their "productivity cocktail" and it might give inspiration for new things to try out. 

My list is as follows (somewhat sorted by morning -> evening):

- **Meditation**
- **7 Minute Workout**
- **Nootropics** (Phenibut and Matcha/L-theaning when needed)
- **GTD** to manage all my projects/todos
- **Productivity Journal** for tasks for the given day (this also uses **MIT's**)
- **Pomodoro** for focused/structured work sessions. Also helps me estimate tasks in Productivity Journal and track effectiveness of the day.
- **Email Batching** (schedule checking email once a day, and to it all at once)
- **Inbox Zero** (for email and notes)
- **Five Minute Journal**
- **Habit Tracking** (to motivate to not break chains to change habits. Basically **X Method** using an app)
- **Five Minute Journaling**
- **DRY** Dont Repeat Yourself. Basically always find ways to make templates/automate things in your work/routine if it's something that needs to be written/done more than once.
